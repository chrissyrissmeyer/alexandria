One view presumes a universal set of cultural values and beliefs, freely drawn on by any residents within the Roman territories. The other considers the Mediterranean to be a world divided by local interests and competing ideas of community and identity. Both views, however, offer a static picture of an Imperial Roman society that underwent a sea change only after the Empire became Christianized in the fourth century. This dissertation offers a new assessment of these topics in order to help create a better understanding of cultural unity, community, and religious change within the Roman Empire. I focus this study on two essential elements of Roman society which cross these topics: travel and religious identity. In pursuing this investigation I employ sources which document the experiences of individual travelers in the Eastern Mediterranean.  aThese sources range from firsthand accounts to intentional fictions and demonstrate the role of religious identity in forming attitudes of and towards travelers. What becomes quite clear is that not only did religious attitudes inform the purpose of travel and the choice of destinations before the fourth century, but also that they offered a means by which travelers could negotiate the communities with which they came into contact. Although particular practices and deities varied by civic community or within a city, ancient travelers relied on a common understanding of religious structures and practices in order to align themselves with the various communities of the Mediterranean.When evidence from the first three centuries is put alongside that provided by Christian pilgrims in the fourth and fifth centuries, it is clear that ideas of hospitality did not significantly change after Rome officially adopted Christianity.  aAlthough Christian ideology has often been considered crucial to religious and social changes in the fourth century, creating a "universal" Roman Empire, this study recommends a reassessment of this view. The travelers' tales I consider give good evidence for a current of universalism within the Roman Empire prior to the full literary expression of Christian ideology.  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aComplete online dissertation available to UC users only. 7aOnline resources.2local 7aDissertations, AcademiczUCSBxHistory.2local2 aUniversity of California, Santa Barbara.bHistory.40zProQuest full text.

As the American founder of a new church that had gone global by 1900, this is not unexpected. Yet unlike scholarship on its founder, scholarship on the Christian Science religion is slight. Historians of religions in America agree that Eddy's denomination has had an outsize influence on American culture and that her main book, Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures, has been widely read. However, in the past fifty years, only one book-length study has been published seeking to interpret the emergence and meaning of the Christian Science denomination in American cultural life. The present study of Science and Health steps into this gap, approaching the history of Christian Science through the lens of what Eddy termed her religion's "textbook." This study uses historical methods rooted in women's, American, religious, print, and book history.  aIt is not essentially biographical, though it attends to how events in Eddy's life resulted in changes to her text and, conversely, how the attention, reception, and use her text received resulted in changes to her thought and life. Each edition of Eddy's book developed alongside its author, printers, publishers, and readers. Thus the evolving editions of Science and Health speak to the development of Christian Science as no other document or set of documents can. I argue that Eddy's Science and Health presents a new phase of American religiosity that resonates and converses with but does not fit within existing categories. Eddy presented her book not as a second, new, or supplemental Bible, but as a revealed work interpreting the principle or science behind the healing in the Bible, which she claimed would renew and extend apostolic life today.  aThis claim emerged, expanded, and continues to operate among a variety of cultural materials and historical domains, which helps us capture her religion's identity more precisely than previously. I ultimately contend that in Christian Science, Eddy introduced a postwar, millennialist restorationism with a revelatory rationale that both intimately interacted with its historical setting and altered its cultural landscape with a new view of Christian healing.  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aComplete online dissertation available to UC users only. 7aOnline resources.2local 7aDissertations, AcademiczUCSBxReligious Studies.2local2 aUniversity of California, Santa Barbara.bReligious Studies.40zProQuest full text.

The goal of this study was to identify the conditions under which female friends might serve as conflict multipliers rather than conflict buffers when discussing a conflict between a female friend and her male romantic partner. Traditional social support literature suggests that social support networks can improve the quality of romantic relationships, but this study proposed that female friendship networks can sometimes hurt romantic relationships, particularly the perceived closeness with the male romantic partner.  aIn particular, this study suggests that Black female social support networks may have stronger effects on perceptions of one's male romantic partner compared to White women due to their unique sociocultural history and socialization to be a "Strong Black Woman." The composition of Black friends upholding this Strong Black Woman ideal may form a "Strong Black Woman Collective," such that Black friends communicatively reinforce the virtues of strength in one another. It was hypothesized that the strength would affect the social support process, and consequently be associated with lower levels of perceived relational closeness for Black women and their male romantic partners. Two hundred and twenty nine Black and White women completed online survey questionnaires and the data were analyzed using a mixed methods approach.  aThe quantitative results revealed that, generally, the conversations about relational conflict among the group of female friends were more comparable than disparate for Black and White women. Both the quantitative and qualitative results indicated that the type of support provided as well as identification to the group, in-group solidarity and derogation of the male partner were common for both groups of women. These effects were significantly associated with a decrease in perceived relational closeness with the male romantic partner. There was also a significant three-way interaction for male prototypicality, the ethnicity of the woman, and derogation of the male partner for relational closeness. For Black women who had lower to moderate levels of male prototypicality during their conversation about the conflict among their female friends, derogation of the male romantic partner was significantly associated with women feeling less close with their romantic partner.  aWhen male prototypicality was high, there was no significant association between derogation and perceived relational closeness. For White women who perceived the male partner to have any level of male prototypicality (high, moderate, or low), increased derogation was significantly associated with them feeling less close to their male romantic partner. The qualitative results also revealed a distinct difference in the way Black women and White women communicate their support. A thematic analysis of the open-end remarks revealed that White friends were much more likely than Black friends to express their dual concern for the female friend and the male romantic partner, providing a fair and balanced perspective of both sides. Unlike White women, Black women were more forthright in their opinions of the conflict, using strong derogatory language, and typically sided with the male partner or with the female friend but not both.  aSpecifically, Black women used more direct messages to signal agreement with the female partner and proceeded to derogate the male partners' behavior. Or, on the contrary, they would signal agreement with the male partner and directly communicate to the female friend the error of her ways. This current study is the first to use a social identity perspective as the underlying theoretical framework for the social support process among friendship networks. It extends current research by testing for the harmful, rather than helpful, nature of social support networks across cultural groups.  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aComplete online dissertation available to UC users only. 7aOnline resources.2local 7aDissertations, AcademiczUCSBxCommunication.2local2 aUniversity of California, Santa Barbara.bCommunication.40zProQuest full text.

Although these discourses are often collectively identified as environmentalism, this all-encompassing term contains subtle but important differences that are occluded by the very language of environmentalism. The most important cultural "location" for this phenomenon is the tree, which is a metonym for nature. The tree, as representation, as idea, and as a physical organism, is deployed and understood in very different ways and for very different purposes.These differences are rendered invisible to many research methods because contemporary American culture treats trees with automatic hagiographic respect. Direct questioning, through survey research or traditional interviewing, will reveal only the superficial respect given to trees.  aMore creative interview methods, along with a close reading of the way trees are treated in popular culture, reveal the divergent sensibilities that use arboreal language as a way to understand and give meaning to the relationship between humans and the physical world. Interviews were conducted in public urban and forested areas in California, Kansas, and New York and complemented by hermeneutic analysis of tree imagery in Christmas decorations, advertising, and landscape. Each interview revolved around the infamous 'If you were a tree, what kind of tree would you be?' question made popular by Barbara Walters. The methods, interviews and analysis employed reveal just how many faux-environmentalist sensibilities rely on the idea, image, and planting of trees. When the tree is worshiped, uncritically, as a balm for all the ills of the modern world, it denies ecological thinking.  aThe romanticization of the tree is dangerous because it usurps trees from the plant kingdom and uses them to redecorate and remodel urban environments. Trees are a counter-narrative to modernity, but a failed counter-narrative, an evil détournement. Within these discourses, however, is another sensibility, suggesting ways that even a tree-based rhetoric can shift into a more holistic ecological approach that can eliminate the delineation of nature, as non-man, into a vision of an ecology that permeates the urban and rural Earth.  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aComplete online dissertation available to UC users only. 7aOnline resources.2local 7aDissertations, AcademiczUCSBxSociology.2local2 aUniversity of California, Santa Barbara.bSociology.40zProQuest full text.
